            <p>Swung has been my favorite project to work on over the past couple months. It started with a problem that came to me while playing golf, I don't know what club to hit. Swung calculates how far each club in your bag goes based on only a single shot, taking into account the weather and lie of the ball. I have enjoyed diving into IOS development as I get to explore UX and UI design with this prototype.</p>
