            <h1>The Ideas</h1>
            <p>With a strong passion for business/data analytics, it has been exciting for me to explore ways to expand my knowledge both in and out of the classroom. 
            <br>
            <br>
                For an assignment in my class “The Power of AI: Fundamentals to Applications,” I analyzed energy consumption trends in a large data set that featured variables like temperature, occupancy, and humidity in various buildings. This reinforced my passion for analytics as I began to learn how closely tied data collection and AI efficiency are. I was able to use my experience in a high school class, AP Stats, to aid me in my assessment of the data. Among the images below, is a copy of this assignment.
            <br>
            <br>
                Using a EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services I was able to create a automatic email updater for popular tech stocks. It delivers an email to me at 8 am and 4 pm every day and can be accessed in my GitHub with instructions on how to use it yourself.</p>

            <h1>What I'm working on</h1>
            <p>My next step with these projects involves an implementation of AI. I think it would be very helpful for me to receive recent articles and major news about each of these stocks. I envision my new talents with AI helping me accomplish this goal soon.</p>
